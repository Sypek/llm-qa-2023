# Repository name: llm-qa-2023


This repository contains POC solution to the problem of knowledge retrieval from documentantion.


### Introduction
First of all, I want to underline that as in the task description, the following is only a POC and is used only to demonstrate the feasability of the solution. Based on POC solution it's possible to make more informative decissions for further development.

Mainly, such POC is useful for:
- Answering if this solution is feasible.
- Estimating the effort of production deployment.
- Designing final solution.
- Experimenting with new frameworks.
- Drawing a roadmap of deployment: what is the MVP, what are the project stages, ...
- Determining future bottlenecks, i.e.: which components are slowest, where will be the highest traffic, what will be the main cost of the solution, which functionalities are easy / hard to implement, ...
- Showing customer a first draft of the solution to get initial comments and feedback

### Deliverable
- Github repository with cloud formation template to create infrastructure and code to deploy the app locally.
- Conversation bot is able to embedd documents and user queries and find most relevant documents to the query.
- Bot is extracting the knowledge from the documents and based on this context, bot is formulating the answer as well as returns relative documents.
- Bot has the "memory", so context of the conversation is not lost. It allows for asking subsequent questions.

Here are two short video samples showing the solution (they are fast-forwarded). Inference on the local machine is really slow (around 90 seconds).

### Design

As stated in the task description, I focused on using AWS components as much as I could. Also as mentioned before, I focused only on implementing some of the components to simplify the solution. My decission was motivated by the following factors:
- POC should provide sufficient functionality to demonstrate the faesability of the solution, it doesn't need to be a perfect, ready to go solution
- I wanted to reduce costs of cloud services
- Personal factor: time constraints

In the next sections I will also add comments of possible extensions and things to keep in mind when deploying model and describe simplifications of this solution.

#### Solution architecture (POC)
I've decided to go with pretty straightforward approach of Q&A levering AWS, ML and LLMs.
Infrastrucure on AWS account was created using CloudFormation.

Infrastructure components:
- GUI (chat interface): Streamlit app
- Model serving: SageMaker Endpoint 
- Storage: S3 bucket
- LLM framework: Langchain
- Vector database: Chroma

Diagram of the solution can be seen below:

#### Architecture and frameworks: decision justification
- Vector Database: ChromaDb
    - ChromaDB is popular vector database, often proposed as a default solution in LLM systems. It's sufficient for this POC solution, can be cached and used locally. Supports cosine similarity metrics. Supports filtering based on metadata, which is important from the legal point of view. While querying database, we can filter which documents should / shouldn't be returned, which was one of the requirements of the solution.
        - For simplicity, I loaded data to Chroma in Sagemaker notebook and then saved the db files to S3 bucket. Then, db files was downloaded locally, so I could start local ChromaDb.
- GUI: Streamlit app
    - I was familiar with createing simple GUIs with streamlit so I've decided to go with this framework, it's well-known and commonly used for such tasks.
- Storage:
    - S3 is probably almost all the time go-to solution while working with AWS, unless certain specific requirements are required.
- LLM framework: Langchain
    - Probably most popular LLM framework as of date. Can be used as simple wrapper around many models and allows to create dialog scenarios.
- Processing / computing layer: Sagemaker
    - For ease of use, I leveraged Sagemaker notebooks to perform such operations as deploying endpoints, data preprocessing or loading data to db.
- Model serving:
    - Models were initially hosted as Sagemaker Endpoints but due to quotas on my test account, I was only able to host a single endpoint, which was used to trigger calculation of embeddigns.
    - The other model (generative one) was hosted by me locally using GPT4All.


#### Models
I've used two separate models for this task.
- One model is designed to compute embeddings. This model is a sentence transformer `huggingface-textembedding-all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- The second model is a generative, text2text model, the one used by me locally is `llama-2-7b-chat`.

#### Data processing and conversation chain
Langchain framework was used for converstion between human and bot.

First documents are read using markdown reader. Then, documents are chunked into the smaller parts, embedded and saved in vector db.

For the conversation purpose, I used `ConversationalRetrievalChain` which allows for conversation with retrieval. Context of the conversation is preserved in the memery which allows to further question having in mind previous parts of discussion. Moreover, the solution returns relevant documents.


#### How to improve solution for POC
- Host Streamlit on AWS (for example on EC2 instance)
- Vector database:
    - Host Chroma on AWS (EC2 instance)
    - Use AWS OpenSearch which is AWS version of vector database
- Use Sagemaker Endpoint for Generative LLM instead of locally hosting it

#### How to improve the solution to be closer to production deployment
Before going into production, there are numeroues questions that need answers in order to implement the solution properly.

In this scenario, my advice would be to move everything as much as possible to AWS managed services (and if possible, as much serverless as possible).

Description:
- Application is serverless.
- Authentication is provided by Cognito.
- Static parts of the application are delivered thorugh CloudFront, which is a content delivery system. Not only it provide fast access to static files, it provides caching and gives another layer of security and protection.
- Communication with services goes through custom API behind API Gateway.
- Lambda functions are used to talk with different services: Sagemaker Endpoints and OpenSearch.
- Context of the conversation can be either passed through Lambda (as a parameter, if text is not too long) or can be saved in DynamoDb.
- OpenSearch is used as a vectordatabase.
- Sagemaker endpoints are either serverless (if we allows for slower answers) or real-time, but this time Sagemaker autoscaling is required to handle ups and downs in traffic.
- Finally, documents and data is stored on s3 bucket.
- Data is loaded from s3 to OpenSearch:
    - either as a scheduled event by using EventBridge
    - after adding files to S3
    - data is loaded using SageMaker Processing job or AWS Glue
- All logs for monitoring are stored in CloudWatch


**What is important in this solution, is that everything is managed by AWS and almost every component is serverless.**

### Steps to run the app
1. Use CloudFormation to set up the infrastructure. Main resources that are created: S3 bucket, Sagemaker Notebook Instance, roles.
```
sh infrastructure/create_stack.sh
```````

2. Run python script to upload local data with documentation to S3 bucket.
```
python upload_data_to_s3.py
```

3. Open Sagemaker studio and run those two notebooks, first deploys Sagemaker endpoints, second loads documents from s3, chunks them, embedds each chunk, loads into vector database and finally saves db on s3.
```
notebooks/deploy_endpoints.ipynb
notebooks/create_embeddings.ipynb
```

4. Run the app (locally)
```
cd app 
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
